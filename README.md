# Real-Time-Anomaly-Segmentation [Course Project]
This is 

This code is a toolbox that uses **PyTorch** for training and evaluating the **ERFNet** architecture for semantic segmentation.


NOTE: This PyTorch version has a slightly better result than the ones in the Torch version (used in the paper): 72.1 IoU in Val set and 69.8 IoU in test set.




## Packages
For instructions, please refer to the README in each folder:

* [train](train) contains tools for training the network for semantic segmentation.
* [eval](eval) contains tools for evaluating/visualizing the network's output.
* [imagenet](imagenet) Contains script and model for pretraining ERFNet's encoder in Imagenet.
* [trained_models](trained_models) Contains the trained models used in the papers. 

## Requirements:

* [**The Cityscapes dataset**](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/): Download the "leftImg8bit" for the RGB images and the "gtFine" for the labels. **Please note that for training you should use the "_labelTrainIds" and not the "_labelIds", you can download the [cityscapes scripts](https://github.com/mcordts/cityscapesScripts) and use the [conversor](https://github.com/mcordts/cityscapesScripts/blob/master/cityscapesscripts/preparation/createTrainIdLabelImgs.py) to generate trainIds from labelIds**
* [**Python 3.6**](https://www.python.org/): If you don't have Python3.6 in your system, I recommend installing it with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux)
* [**PyTorch**](http://pytorch.org/): Make sure to install the Pytorch version for Python 3.6 with CUDA support (code only tested for CUDA 8.0). 
* **Additional Python packages**: numpy, matplotlib, Pillow, torchvision and visdom (optional for --visualize flag)
